To do list for Voice Conference Manager - P2006 Edition

* Better Voice User Interface

  - The user interface doesn't have serious error recovery.

  - The user interface doesn't let the clerk select how long the conference call will last.
  
* Configuration

  - While most config variables are in a separate files, there's a raft of config variables that are considered to be common to all users, and that's not the case. For example, we ought to be able to select, on a per-attendant basis, how many call legs are allowed.
  
  - The clerk is identified via caller ID. Clearly, the clerk should be allowed to verify with a name and PIN in case the clerk is calling from an unexpected location.

* CCXML Improvements

  - CCXML does not have complete coverage of all error legs

  - Current CCXML has the last leg in the chain as the one that destroys the conference object. It makes a lot more sense to use the conference object connections property, but the conference object is not yet available on P2006.
  
* VoiceXML improvements

  - Voice User Interface: the goal is to demonstrate code, not VUI, and the VUI certainly would never be "does not match." That's intended solely for the use of a developer.

* Logic Improvements

  - The logic of how conf_legs.php work can change. We could have one conf_master.php that holds the conference object, and make serial copies of conf_legs.php which outdial to each callee and <move>'s that callee, when they answer, to conf_master.php. The advantage would be that we could track how many callers are on the call, and teardowns would be easier.
  
  However, since the main goal of that version is to overcome the current lack of a conference object with a count of connections, we'll just use this current version for the forseeable future.
