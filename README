ABOUT VOICE CONFERENCE MANAGER

Voice Conference Manager (VCM) uses VoiceXML, CCXML, and grXML to create a
voice conference call system. A "clerk" calls a telephone number to set up
a conference call. The clerk says the names of all the participants, and
then hangs up. A server then calls each participant and adds them to the
conference call.

The system also includes a web-based monitoring system. By viewing a web
page, the conference owner or members of the conference call can see who is
on the call. (In the future, the conference call will be controlled by the
web page interface.)

ABOUT THE GIT REPOSITORY

There are three subfolders here:

- 'vcm' - a platform-independent implementation of the Voice Conference
  Manager

- 'vcm-prophecy' - a VCM version developed for Voxeo's Prophecy platform
  (freely available at http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/ )

- 'push2web' - provides VCM with a web page that can monitor and control 
   a conference call. 

Please see the "README.txt" files located in each subfolder for more
information about each project.
