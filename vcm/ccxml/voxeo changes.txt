Things changed to get web site stuff to run on the Voxeo site:

** eventprocessor (last call) -> eventhandler (beta)

** connection.altering (beta) -> connection.CONNECTION_ALERTING (last call)

(and similar changes)

** <dialogstart>'s connectionid (last call) -> callid (beta)

connectionid (last call) => callid (event)

** fetch.done (last call) => ccxml.fetch.done (beta)

** <(create|destroy)conference> conferenceid (last call) => id (beta)
