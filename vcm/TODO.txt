To do list for Voice Conference Manager

* Better User Interface

  - The user interface doesn't have serious error recovery.

  - The user interface doesn't let the clerk select how long the conference call will last.
  
  - Make a web-page interface to CCXML. (This is actually rather straightforward.) == DONE
  
  - Make web-page interface to CCXML status go only to one user at a time!
  
* Configuration

  - Figure out a way to have a config file for URLs. XSL? Python? sed? PHP? == DONE


* CCXML Improvements

  - When CCXML intepreter is closer to W3C spec, and W3C spec is revised, the scripts will have to be revised.

  - When ECMAScript interpreter is revised, use arrays and not the text-based method of storing phone numbers
  
* VoiceXML improvements

  - Better Voice User Interface
