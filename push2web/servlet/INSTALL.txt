INSTALLATION

The simplest way to install is place "push2web.war" into the voxeo/webapps directory. Restart the vappserver ("prophecy restart vappserver") and the system will be up and running.

In the remainder of this document, I discuss how to build this system from scratch.


== Servers

This software runs on a web server that supports Java servlets and JSP. For example, Prophecy 2006 includes an ordinary web server on port 9990 and a Java servlet/JSP server -- Jetty -- on port 9991.

To build, use "ant," an Apache Java utility. The included "build.xml" file includes the target "war" which which will create push2web.war.

To install, place the WAR file into the appropriate directory. On Prophecy 2006, that would be Program Files/Voxeo/webapps, and then restart the Jetty server ("prophecy restart vappserver").

== Configuration Files

The push2web.xml file (which becomes "web.xml" in the WAR file) contains the PublicPort variable used by the browser.

The data you send to the browser is formatted by SendToBrowserFormat.java. In some future release, this could be a configurable file; in the meantime, to alter the format you must alter the file and recompile.

Data goes to the servet at "/send.do." The name, location, URL pattern, etc. can be configured in push2web.xml.

EXAMPLE:

To send data about a call in progress to the web page, fetch the following URL:

http://p2006server:9991/push2web/send.do?destName=Moshe&destPhone=tel:xxxxxxxxxxx&confName=foo&report=ringing"

Explanation:

p2006server -- machine name of P2006 server.
9991 -- port on P2006 server for JSP and servlets
send.do -- servlet that sends data to browser

Data we send:

destName = Moshe -- name of person on call
destPhone = tel:xxxxxxxxxxx -- phone number of that person
confName = foo -- name of confererence. 
report = ringing -- state of call, such as "connected," "ringing," "dropped."

This data can also be sent using POST.
