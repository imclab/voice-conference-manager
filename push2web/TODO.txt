To do list for push2web - P2006 Edition

* Move to XML

  - send XML text between server and browser -- AJAX-like model

* Authentication

  - Create login or other token for web page. Send data from conference only to authenticated user.


* CSS

  - make demo HTML page into nicer CSS version

* Configuration

  - push2web is a WAR file. Should config information be in a separate text XML file? Right now it's in the web.xml file, which means that any change requires re-compile of WAR archive.
